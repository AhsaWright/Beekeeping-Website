# CS IA Bee-Themed Website

## 1. Front-End Development

### Design the Website Layout (HTML/CSS)
- **Task**: Start by creating the structure of your website. 
- **Action**: Use HTML to build the core elements (header, nav bar, content sections, footer). For styling, apply CSS to create a bee-themed design. Consider warm tones like yellows and blacks, and a blocky design to represent honeycombs.
- **Tools**: HTML, CSS, and optionally a design framework like Bootstrap for responsiveness.

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Task**: Make sure the site looks good on mobile devices.
- **Action**: Use CSS media queries to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes. Consider frameworks like Bootstrap or custom CSS for this.

### Accessibility
- **Task**: Ensure users with disabilities can navigate the site.
- **Action**: Add ARIA labels to elements, support keyboard navigation, and include screen-reader-friendly content.

## 2. Database Setup

### Choose and Set Up a Database
- **Task**: Select a database for storing bee species, user content, and donations.
- **Action**: Decide between SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for structured data or NoSQL (MongoDB) for more flexible data. Create tables/collections for bee data, blog posts, user profiles, and donations.

### Data Filters
- **Task**: Enable users to search for bees by characteristics.
- **Action**: Use SQL queries or MongoDB aggregation to filter results by species, color, region, etc.

## 3. Back-End Development

### Set Up the Environment
- **Task**: Create a back-end server to manage the app’s data.
- **Action**: Use Node.js (Express framework) or Python (Flask/Django) for setting up the back-end. Set up routes for your database interactions and user authentication.

### User Authentication
- **Task**: Let users sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
- **Action**: Implement authentication using libraries such as Passport.js for Node.js or Flask-Login for Python.

## 4. API Integration

### External API Integration
- **Task**: Provide real-time data (e.g., weather updates for beekeeping).
- **Action**: Use APIs like OpenWeatherMap to pull in weather data based on user location and integrate it into the site.

### Newsletter Functionality
- **Task**: Enable users to subscribe to updates.
- **Action**: Use MailChimp’s API to allow users to sign up for a newsletter.

## 5. Advanced Features

### Bee Identifier (Machine Learning)
- **Task**: Implement a feature that identifies bee species based on images.
- **Action**: Use TensorFlow.js to integrate machine learning directly in the browser. Load a pre-trained model or train a custom one using the provided bee dataset.

### Interactive Map
- **Task**: Show beekeeping associations and locations of known bee colonies.
- **Action**: Use the Google Maps API to allow users to add pins for sightings, colonies, or associations.

### Donation Tracker
- **Task**: Gamify user donations with progress bars.
- **Action**: Display dynamic graphs tracking community goals using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

## 6. Testing and Debugging

### Test Functionalities
- **Task**: Test the website’s functionality and usability.
- **Action**: Ensure all features (search, bee identifier, maps, donations) work as intended. Debug issues with code, UI responsiveness, or database queries.

## 7. Documentation

### Document the Process
- **Task**: Maintain thorough records of your work.
- **Action**: Document your development process, decisions made, and outcomes. Include user guides for features like searching, posting, and using the bee identifier.
